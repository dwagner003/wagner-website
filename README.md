# WagnerWebsite

Front end for my personal website. Uses Angular 9 and Bootstrap for the site. Also integrates with Auth0 to allow for route gaurds to be used for certain elements and endpoints that should only be avaiable to authorized users. 

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
